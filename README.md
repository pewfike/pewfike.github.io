    --light-text: #6b7280;
    --background: #ffffff;
    --section-bg: #f3f4f6;
}
```

### Blog Posts

To add or modify blog posts, edit the `blogPosts` array in `script.js`:

```javascript
const blogPosts = [
    {
        title: 'Your Blog Title',
        excerpt: 'Blog post excerpt...',
        date: 'YYYY-MM-DD',
        image: 'image-url',
        link: 'post-link'
    },
    // Add more posts...
];
```

### Social Links

Update the social media links in the footer section of `index.html`:

```html
<div class="social-links">
    <a href="your-github-url" target="_blank"><i class="fab fa-github"></i></a>
    <a href="your-linkedin-url" target="_blank"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a>
    <a href="your-twitter-url" target="_blank"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a>
